## Lec 13

### Question 1

Consider the following scenario: Researchers are testing two versions of a virtual assistant: one that offers brief responses and another that provides detailed explanations. Participants are invited to a lab, where they interact with both versions. They are instructed to ask a pre-defined set of questions, such as “What time is it in Tokyo?” and “How do I connect my phone to Wi-Fi?”. The order of the versions is randomized to prevent learning effects. Researchers measure response time through system logs and user satisfaction via post-interaction surveys. 

**Which of the following aspects of this experiment may reduce its ecological validity?**

- The participants ask only pre-selected questions, which may not reflect the full variety of inquiries users typically make in their daily interactions.
- The experiment takes place in a controlled lab environment, which doesn’t account for interruptions or distractions that occur in real-world usage.
- Participants interact with both versions of the assistant in a back-to-back setup, which may not reflect how users engage with virtual assistants at different times throughout the day.
- Participants know they are being observed, which may change how they interact with the virtual assistant compared to unmonitored, everyday use

**Correct Answer:**
All of the above
